                    <h2>To my beloved Jevonne, </h2>
                    <p>Uhm hi! So… I know this is very late siudfgasdugf and I know that I’ve said a lot of things that hurt you, and I’ve disappointed you very much, but I still want to show you how much I value our relationship, and most importantly you! Happy 19th birthday my partner in kagaguhan, my bickering buddy, my sassy babe, my Jevonne. It’s been 3 damn years since we met?! HASDHASDHSA WE WERE SUCH NAIVE CHILDREN LIKE DAMN HASDHAS, we both have been through a lot, especially you! You’ve changed so much, I think you’re now a lot more confident, more sure, and more sassy 0.0 but you’re also now more open, more vulnerable, and prettier uwu adsuifgbadsuifogds. I really really really miss you dude, not a day goes by where I don’t think of you, where I don’t think of what it’d be like if I could just go back in time just to give you a kiss again dshfausdfih, its always so fun and painful when we meet because I know we always have to leave again aiusdhfuisadf, but I know, as long as we’re together, na there’s always a next time!!! You’ve been the biggest gift in my life, and I’m so so so proud of you and, all that you’ve accomplished!!! I hope that one day we can celebrate your birthday in person, I can cook the nicest dinner ever for us hehe Here’s to more birthdays, I love you Jevonne.</p>
